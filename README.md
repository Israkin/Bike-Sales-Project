# Project Name: Bike Sales


----
# Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to solve the problem associated with low sales and how bike selling companies within Europe, North America and the pacific can focus on a target audience that will yield more sales conversion.

# Data sourcing
This dataset contains information about 1,027 customers who purchased bikes and some of the information includes their Marital status, Gender, Income, cummute distance, Age among others. Data was sourced from a licensed data set on Kaggle.com

# Data Transformation
First before the data transformation, Python libraries were not imported neither was it read from the csv file. Due to the fact that this an Excel project and was documented using screenshots and value definition where appropriate.

Data wrangling was done in Excel and I was able to extract some basic information from the dataset. I was able to deduce that there are no missing values in any column but thorough cleaning was done on certain columns such as the Marital status, Gender, Income and Age.

The next process is data cleaning, the first process of cleaning was done by dropping duplicates found in the dataset as well as renaming columns where appropriate.

Data was explored and the questions asked were put to the test. The first question of “Which gender bought more bikes” was first tackled, up until the last question of "Which Age range bought more bikes"
Bar charts and Pie charts as well as Columns were plotted where necessary.

# Findings and Recommendations
The Male accounted for the gender group that bought more bikes, rightly so because when the average income of each gender was explored, the Male appears to earn more than the Female. therefore, Bike stores should focus more on Men with an average income of $60,000 per annum.

Also, since the single Male accounts for the highest number of purchases, they should be targeted during any Ad.

There are more people in North America who buy bikes than there is in Europe or the Pacific.
